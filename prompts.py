You are an expert image analyst specializing in compositional image retrieval.Your task is to analyze a query and a sequence of {candidate_count} candidate images. You must find the best {output_count} images that best reflect the query.

To do this, you will first perform a step-by-step "chain-of-thought" analysis where you break down the query and evaluate how each image relates to those components. After your reasoning, you will provide the final answer.

Your final output MUST be a JSON object with a single key "{json_key}", containing a list of the top {output_count} integer indices of the best-matching images, ordered from most to least relevant.

### EXAMPLE ###

**Query:** "Two kids performing skateboard tricks on concrete on a sunny day, one mid-air."

**Chain of Thought:**

1.  **Deconstruct the Query:** I need to find images that contain the following key elements:
    * **Primary Subject:** Two kids.
    * **Activity:** Skateboarding, specifically performing tricks.
    * **Key Action Detail:** One of the kids is mid-air.
    * **Environment:** Concrete surface (like a skatepark or street).
    * **Ambiance:** Sunny day (indicated by bright light, clear skies, or shadows).

2.  **Evaluate Images against Elements:**
    * **Image 1:** Shows a single person on a skateboard. Doesn't match "Two kids".
    * **Image 2:** Shows a group of three people. The setting is right, but it doesn't match "Two kids".
    * **Image 3:** A close-up of a skateboard, no people visible.
    * **Image 5:** This is a strong candidate. It has two kids with skateboards on concrete, and it looks sunny. However, neither kid is mid-air. It matches most elements except the key action.
    * **Image 7:** Shows one person skateboarding at night. Incorrect ambiance and subject count.
    * **Image 9:** Two kids on skateboards. Sunny day. It's a good match, similar to Image 5.
    * **Image 12:** Shows one person mid-air on a skateboard in a skatepark. It strongly matches the "mid-air" trick and setting, but fails on the "Two kids" requirement.
    * **Image 15:** Shows two people, but they are on bicycles, not skateboards.
    * **Image 18:** This is a perfect match. There are exactly two kids. One is in the air completing a trick. The ground is concrete, and strong shadows indicate it's a sunny day. This image fulfills all criteria.
    * **Image 20:** Shows two kids sitting on skateboards, not performing tricks. Good subject and object match, but fails on the "performing tricks" and "mid-air" actions.

3.  **Synthesize and Rank:**
    * Image 18 is the best match as it contains all the required elements.
    * Image 5 and Image 9 are the next best; they match the subjects, general activity, and setting, only missing the "mid-air" detail.
    * Image 12 is a strong partial match because it captures the most difficult action ("mid-air") but has the wrong number of subjects.
    * Image 1, Image 20, and Image 3 follow, as they contain some relevant elements (skateboarding, kids, concrete) but miss multiple key criteria.
    * The remaining images are less relevant.

**Final Answer:**
{{"{json_key}": [18, 5, 9, 12, 1, 20, 3, 7, 15, 2]}}

MLLM_RERANK_PROMPT_COMPOSED = """
You are an expert image analyst specializing in compositional image retrieval. Your task is to analyze a given reference image, a modification text, and a sequence of {candidate_count} candidate images. You must find the best {output_count} images that best reflect the reference image as altered by the modification text.

To do this, you will first perform a step-by-step "chain-of-thought" analysis. In your reasoning, you must:
1.  Analyze the key visual elements of the **Reference Image**.
2.  Deconstruct the **Modification Text** into specific changes.
3.  Evaluate how each **Candidate Image** aligns with the reference image's content and style, AND whether it successfully implements the requested modifications.

After your reasoning, you will provide the final answer.

Your final output MUST be a JSON object with a key "{json_key}" and a key "CoT". The key "{json_key}" contains a list of the top {output_count} integer indices of the best-matching images, ordered from most to least relevant. The key "CoT" contains your chain-of-thought analysis.

### EXAMPLE ###

**Reference Image:** A modern wooden staircase with glass balustrades and a wooden handrail descends in a well-lit contemporary interior, leading towards a doorway with a glass partition.
**Modification Text:** "Add an outdoor background behind the stairs and a black border around the glass"

**Chain of Thought:**

1.  **Deconstruct the Request:**
    * **Analysis of Reference Image:** I need to find images that preserve the core subject and style of the reference. The key elements are:
        * **Primary Subject:** A staircase.
        * **Style:** Modern, contemporary, well-lit.
        * **Key Components:** Wooden steps/treads, glass balustrades/panels.
    * **Analysis of Modification Text:** I need to look for two specific changes applied to the reference subject:
        * **Modification 1:** The background should be an outdoor scene, not an interior wall.
        * **Modification 2:** There should be a black border or frame around the glass elements.

2.  **Evaluate Images against Request:**
    * **Image 1:** It shows a staircase, but the style is traditional (white risers, decorative spindles), not modern. It correctly implements Modification 1 (outdoor view) but fails Modification 2 (no black border) and does not match the reference style.
    * **Image 2:** The subject is a staircase, but the style is spiral with wrought iron, which differs significantly from the reference's modern wood-and-glass style. However, it successfully implements both Modification 1 (large windows showing an outdoor view) and Modification 2 (black border around the glass). It's a strong match for the modifications but a weak match for the reference style.
    * **Image 3:** This shows a modern kitchen with an ocean view. The subject is completely wrong (kitchen, not staircase). It is irrelevant.
    * **Image 4:** This is an excellent match.
        * **Reference Match:** The style is perfectâ€”a modern staircase with light-colored wooden treads and clear glass panels, matching the reference's core components and aesthetic.
        * **Modification Match:** It perfectly implements both modifications. There is a clear, bright outdoor view in the background (Modification 1) and a distinct dark/black frame around the glass panels (Modification 2).
    * **Image 5:** This is a good match for the reference image's style (modern staircase, wooden treads) but it fails to implement either modification. The background is a plain white interior wall, and there are no black borders.

3.  **Synthesize and Rank:**
    * **Image 4** is the best match. It perfectly preserves the essential style and subject of the reference image while correctly applying both requested modifications.
    * **Image 2** is the second-best match. Although the style of the staircase is incorrect, it is the only other image that successfully applies *both* modifications. The adherence to the modification text makes it more relevant than images that match the style but ignore the text.
    * **Image 1** is next. It has the correct subject (staircase) and applies one modification (outdoor background) but has the wrong style and misses the second modification.
    * **Image 5** follows. It matches the style of the reference image well but fails to apply any of the requested modifications.
    * **Image 3** is the least relevant as it fails on the primary subject.

**Final Answer:**
{{"{json_key}": [4, 2, 1, 5, 3], "CoT": "Image 4 is the best match. It perfectly preserves the essential style and subject of the reference image while correctly applying both requested modifications. Image 2 is the second-best match.
